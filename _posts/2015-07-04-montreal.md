  that necessity which is present in the least amount. And, naturally, the
  least favorable condition controls the growth rate.

*Dune* is an epic of ecology---which is the same as saying it's a novel of complex, tightly woven
relationships and interactions that make a *whole* much greater than the sum of their 
parts.[^1] Such a grand and multifaceted novel lends itself to any number of comparisons, the lion's
share of which I'll have to decline. The seemingly futile attempt to wring
liveable conditions out of an unforgiving atmosphere still may haunt us as a vision
of the season's beginning, for example, but I won't address it here. I'll ignore the conflict between local and global
interests in defining the values of a *place*, which would certainly apply in the case of NYCFC (although, in *Dune*, read "galactic" and "planetary" interests for "global" and "local").
Less than charitable musings about which player[^a] might be most naturally
inclined to 
"walk without rhythm"[^b] and therefore be least likely to "attract the worm"[^c] are hard to turn
down. And I'm *just barely* containing an extended ecological metaphor about the unknowable effects of
introducing even a single unknown element (let alone *four*!) into a working ecosystem. I want you to know that I'm exercising restraint, is my
point.

Instead, I want to talk about *limits* to growth, in an ecological sense, when it comes to NYCFC and even MLS as a whole.<!--break-->
The "Law of the Minimum" is adapted from an actual ecological law discovered by Justus von Liebig, a 19th-century soil scientist and proto-ecologist. 
When applied, this law tells us that the key to meaningful development, enrichment, and growth isn't just accumulation, but
*targeted* accumulation that bolsters the thing the natural system has the least of. Accumulation for its own sake, 
therefore, gives way to accumulation for the sake of spurring growth in the
system as a whole. That's part
one: part two says, find the limiting factor and minimize it, figure out what the
weakest part of the system is and reduce the extent to which it limits you. In
*Dune*, these principles are first and most obviously applied to water, the lack of which makes life on the
planet a dry, chafing hell. But the hero internalizes this law and later uses it to
achieve economic and military dominance: he creates an artificial scarcity of another resource
(which is both a fuel and a drug) to
decolonize the planet and turn it into a major galactic power.

In other words, improving a system composed of many complex interrelationships, whether
it's a desert ecology or a football club, means finding the thing in least
supply and preventing it from limiting the rest of the system.

The question if we're going to pursue this, then, is what exactly do our impending *arrivistes* bring to the club, and how does
it remove the limiting factors to growth in our current system? What's limiting the development of our
tactical system and individual players, and will these incoming players undo
that limitation? It's undeniable that the
squad we've got has improved tremendously since the beginning of the winless
streak, but at the same time I'm sure I'm not alone in hoping for a bit of a
turning point to the season with the arrival of Lampard, Pirlo, Iraola, and Angelino.
This might seem like a fancy way of asking if they're bringing something other
than a better version of what we already have, but my point actually differs slightly. I'm asking if what they
bring will help the team as a whole grow into itself in a way that goes beyond
the sum of four individual contributions.

The news, from this perspective, is good. I think the things we've lacked all season---the factors limiting us, in other
words---are things we still lack now: convincing
fullbacks, transition to the final third, and reliable finishing. What I think we've had intermittently in Villa is
clear leadership, but it's needed more consistency. There have been plenty of times when it seems like everyone is
waiting around for a push in the right direction. 

I'll take each in its turn. The
fullback situation: it's obviously being addressed, and in my perspective, addressed well. While pecking order will still
have to be established, especially on the left, more depth will allow players like Calle and Allen[^2] 
to develop without needing to bail the team out while they do so.
*Next!* 

Transitions: if anyone has doubts about Pirlo and Lampard, it isn't about the effect
they'll have on transitioning into the final third. Pirlo, for one, can apparently thread a pass from
the near third to the far third without setting down his Chianti. This
improvement 
will give everyone a chance to spend more time in the attacking
zone, the only way our performance when we get there is likely to improve.
*Next!* 

Finishing: in the short term we're adding two tested finishers (I've basically
*seen* Pirlo *pouring* a very full glass of Pinot Nero while sinking a thirty-yard free kick, and
that's just while he was sauntering down Fifth Ave). In the long term, I direct
you to my point
above: more time in the box means more attempts to finish under pressure,
and thus, the key to improvement. *Next!* 

Leadership: much has been said about this already.
Lampard seems like a clear mentor type. As for Pirlo, as long as his English is
good enough or gets there soonish, I think he can be more of a force in the locker room
than anyone else we could have signed. The evidence is all over his many accolades from
his days in Italy, and I don't think that will stop being the case in New
York.
Those who don't seem to think he's committed are mixing up not giving a fuck
and *sprezzatura*.[^3]

It's hardly necessary to respond to the critics of NYCFC's transfer strategy,
who say implausibly that what we're doing is short-termism at its worst or, preposterously, that it's a
merch-selling ploy. Unnecessary, but for funsies: bringing this kind of talent
into the squad will do more than just get results for the duration of the
relevant contracts; it's going to free up space and relieve pressure on the 
younger players, which is necessary if they are going to mature as we want them to.
It's also going to open up tactical options that will let NYCFC figure out once
and for all how it plays, or doesn't play---and personally, I hope this will
mean we can grow out of our necessary cynicism on the road. What we've lacked,
ultimately, is a supply of committed players with nothing to prove, the type of
player who gives others room to grow in their shadow. With the incoming
signings, I think we'll have it.

Finally, this is not something that's good for NYCFC alone. The limiting factor for MLS
is a scarcity of players who fans can expect will, at any given moment, do
something amazing. There *have* been plenty and there *are* plenty still, and
many of them are Americans---just to get that out there before I'm actually
crucified. But that kind of player is what's in the shortest supply, increasing
which will force everyone else to improve apace. While the parity of the league is something I
admire, unless it's threatened and has to reassert itself through a
league-wide increase in quality of play, parity will mean complacency. NYCFC is
giving something to the league by giving something to itself, even if, for
many, it's just a more powerful villain.

[^1]: A hackneyed phrase, but one I pick up in this context from Carolyn Merchant's *Radical Ecology*. As I [discussed via Willa Cather](http://www.hudsonriverblue.com/2015/5/6/8561615/whats-in-a-club-culture-nycfc-vs-willa-cather), this is also a concept I think is necessary to understand what it means to support a club.

[^2]: It's not a universally held opinion, but I think R. J. Allen has a place in this squad, especially with a few years of development. It may seem like he showed up at the bus stop one day with a suitcase full of crumpled suits and uncooked sausages, asking politely to be taken somewhere he could get warm, and somehow ended up starting for us at right back---but remember that he was drafted fifth overall in the supplemental draft of 2012 for Chivas, but didn'tsign. And he's done remarkable things too many times now for it to be luck.
