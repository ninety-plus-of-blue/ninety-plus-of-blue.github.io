Just hold on: this is not pessimism. Odysseus knows what's coming for him and his crew, more or less, and even though that means sirens, Scylla and Charybdis, he still *guides them through* it all. And take another look at the passage. The value of the prophecy is not that it guides what they do---instrumentally, it's quite useless. The forecast alters only the state of their knowledge about what is going to happen, not the events. It is not even a comfort. The one thing Odysseus is able to do as a result of the knowledge, ordering the crew's famous plugging-of-the-ears against the Sirens' song and his own orders, creates the conditions for even more knowledge that cannot be made into action.<!--break--> Odysseus is able to gather data, but he is unable to do anything but hold the course set at the beginning. The forecast remains pure, a structure of knowledge that *will be* without the extra variables that come from acting on foreknowledge---is a forecast correct if action is taken to alter it? and so forth. No: there's a tension between knowledge and action that, before Heisenberg and his uncertainty principle,[^3]  you would have to look for in prophecy. Most contemporary versions of common sense would suggest that you should have as much information as possible and react to it as quickly, and as fully, as possible. Odysseus's episode with the sirens suggests an alternative model.

Christ if Kreis doesn't kind of even *look* like an Odysseus---and I'm not saying so because I'm confounding Odysseus with Kirk Douglas in *Spartacus* (whom now that you mention it he actually does kind of look like[^1]). The roster, the tactical decisions, and the calmness of his manner with the media have been excellent, but even without them, and  even despite occasionally baffling squad selections,[^2] this Odysseus-like staying of the course makes him one of the only people to do this very peculiar job he's landed. His commentary from the beginning has focused on where the team is with respect to what can be expected, dotted with phrases like "ahead of schedule" and, occasionally, the reverse. And so I could extend the analogy too far and make Circe into Kreis's stint at Real Salt Lake, Scylla and Charybdis Colorado and Kansas City, Polyphemus would I guess be New England, blah blah, but of course I would never. 

My point here is I hope more subtle, but also therefore (ha) more useless. My point is that Kreis has known from the beginning that things like aimless-seeming midfields that are best cut out of the loop entirely at times by long balls over the top---that such things are probably unavoidable, though we'll "baffle [them] if we can"; and that nevertheless, despite the knowledge, it may be the best that can be done to "die / with our eyes open." Think, for example, of Sporting KC's goal. They knew it would be coming, they practiced their defense against the long-throw set piece, and there was nothing to be done. All that preparation was useless against a well-timed leap. Similarly, knowing that things are going to get worse before they get better---and that's what I'm really getting at, here---is not going to make it a ton easier, in the end. Remember that foreknowledge is not automatically comfort. And even knowing *why* things are going to get worse before they get better probably won't fix it automatically, and there's every reason to have faith that Kreis and his coaches will know why.

The point, finally, is twofold. You could imagine an ideal management, guarantee the best coaches and the perfect decisions, and there would still have to be a rough patch just by virtue of the task---and I do think a difficult stretch is coming, not necessarily in results, but rather in a continuation of the kind of play we've seen over the past two matches. The people in charge of it all have to play the long game, have to stick to the course, and I'm steeling myself for wise patience that might at times seem like inaction. I'm reminded of an interview[^4] with Billy Beane, the Moneyball guy and GM of the Oakland Athletics, in which he confesses that he sometimes has to listen to the game on his car radio instead of from inside the stadium to prevent himself from making impulsive decisions based on short-term runs of form. (And if that isn't Odyssean in the sense I've been talking about here, well....) As for the second part: in the meantime, it would probably be best for us fans to "die / with our eyes open, if we are going to die, / or know what death we baffle if we can," and try not to forget what is preordained for this season. Especially in the stands, at home, where our support can make the difference.
