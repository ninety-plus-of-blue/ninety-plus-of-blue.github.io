  When thirty rolling years have run their race, <br>
  Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space, <br>
  Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame, <br>
  Which from this omen shall receive the name. <br>
  Time shall approve the truth. For what remains, <br>
  And how with sure success to crown thy pains, <br>
  With patience next attend. A banish'd band, <br>
  Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land, <br>
  Have planted here.... <br>
  These make thy friends, and on their aid rely. <br>
  To thy free passage I submit my streams. ...In times to come, <br>
  My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome.<br>

“We are building a club here for the next 100 years.” This quote, from Kreis,
is slightly dated at this point, but I want to return to it in addressing this
week's quote. What I think we've all appreciated in our manager (when we've
remembered to) is this imperial scope to his ambitions, if not, one
hopes, an imperial mindset.[^1] I won't revisit the themes of [the post in
which I compare Kreis to
Odysseus](http://ninetyplusofblue.com/homer/2015/03/28/kansas-city-odyssey/), though writing on *The Aeneid* would
obviously be a convenient opportunity to rehash the point. I want to focus
instead on the transfer strategies we're seeing Kreis et al. begin to put into
place, and ask how those strategies are going to serve us going forward.
Spoiler alert: I'm pretty clearly suggesting that, with them, we shall "build a
royal town, of lasting fame" like "the walls of mighty Rome."

A bit of Virgil first, though.<!--break--> Aeneas, like his Greek counterpart
Odysseus, has been enduring unending travels and travails, generally getting his shit wrecked, and breaking
the hearts of [British singer-songwriters who have been sampled in Eminem
tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido). Because *The Aeneid* was
commissioned by the emperor Augustus, though, it has to have an ending
befitting a national epic: unlike Odysseus, Aeneas does not return home, but
instead lands in a new place entirely that will eventually become
Rome. First, though, he has to drive out the fearsome Turnus, the previous
inhabitant of Latinum, where he's landed. The scene I've quoted here is an address by
the spirit of the river Tiber to Aeneas, urging him to seek the help of
Evander and his exiled Arcadians. Ultimately, it's only with the help of this
well-dressed, thickly bearded Italian with a penchant for fine wines[^3] that Aeneas can convert his
years of suffering into the beginning of a centuries-long legacy.

Did I tip my hand with that last one? It's a far-flung comparison: millennia of
history set aside (and when aren't they), Pirlo's presumably-former[^2] home of Turin isn't anywhere near Rome, and for
the analogy to really stick he'd have to already have BEEN in New York when Kreis and NYCFC got here. And I'm less
scared of Red Bull than the Turnus comparison would demand. But for the kind of
dominance we're all dreaming of, for longevity of Roman proportions, sticking
for too long with only what we've got would only be an impediment.

The problem, of course, is that this is a complicated prospect, from a fan
perspective as well as a tactical one. Others have
already covered, from almost every conceivable angle, the potential
difficulties of incorporating Pirlo's unique style into a still-fragile system
in NYCFC's midfield. What I'm talking about, though, is that even saying we need somebody new makes me feel
like the callous narrator of a "Don't Think Twice It's Alright"-style
I'm-leaving-you ballad: ultimately entitled to look ahead to what's next, but still kind of a cad and a chauvinist. Because the team that got us here did so through
enormous difficulties and pretty obvious self-doubt, but the ones who will get
to enjoy the conditions of confidence and (one hopes) prosperity of results
have either abandoned us in the past or probably haven't been paying attention
to the team until a couple months ago. The thing that makes me
most happy about the timing of our (as of now three-game) winning streak is
that it gives a tangible, recorded result to attach to all the work done by our
stalwarts, so that
nobody can say the team was a shambles until the European legends arrived.
Credit will have to be given where it's due by any responsible account.
Nevertheless, odds
are that some of the players who have impressed and delighted us most are going to
be on the bench, and some others of whom we've become fond despite their lack of playing time will be packing a bag (and some already have). 

So that said, I'm not going to go over the well-trod ground of whether Pirlo is
a good signing, largely because I think he unquestionably is. I am just going
to take a second instead to inhabit this strange, admittedly sappy middle
state of appreciating what has been done already while looking forward to the next
era. We need the patrician-like aplomb of Andrea Pirlo, not only to balance
out the renegade-cousin vibe of Villa or the uncle-who-understands-you look of
Lampard, but also to help bring the young and still somewhat raw talent like
Mix and Shelton to the next level by example and mentorship. (After all, the real hope is with the next
generation: it's Aeneas's son Ascanius who really begins the work of
developing Latinum into Rome.) We need these Italian alliances: but we also needed what has happened
to get us this far, a third of the way through the season and still very much in the competition.

*The Illiad* and (to a lesser extent) *The Odyssey* are famous for their litanies, for endless listing of the
names of those who participated in sieges, manned ships, fell in some
now-anonymous battle to an unrecorded blow. Perhaps it's because *The Aeneid*
begins with the loss of the Trojan War, rather than a victory in it, that
Virgil feels no such documentary impulse: the people we remember
are those who make it through to establish the more palatable part of the
history. 

What I'm getting at, at last, is this: take a moment, while you're
rubbing your hands with anticipatory glee, and say a prayer for Nemec. 

[^1]: Contrary to the grumblings of the Cosmos fans. I was going to try to work this NYCFC-as-imperial-usurper theme into a graceful way of comparing them with the Picts, but fuck it, who needs grace: Cosmos supporters are kind of like THIS: ![images/picts.jpg](/images/picts.jpg)
