quote: |
    We believe that civilization was forged by the driving force of vital necessity, at the cost of instinct-satisfaction, and that the process is to a large extent constantly repeated anew, since each individual who newly enters the human community repeats the sacrifices of his instinct-satisfaction for the sake of the common good.

A little more than four months have passed since the first home game in NYCFC's
history. I remember seeing other supporters for the first time on the subway
platform: the surprise of it, my relief at the confirmation that there would, indeed, be a
match happening at Yankee Stadium---that it wasn't an elaborate scheme to sell
imaginary tickets for an imaginary season. On March 15th, freezing asses in contiguous seats
would become the basis for a community that would celebrate together briefly before
being disappointed together for a much longer stretch, as loss after loss
rolled in. Then  one day the levy broke and
we got the results we'd been waiting for, results that the team's performances deserved to get much sooner. 

That second honeymoon has ended
now. In the past two matches many, including myself, have seen the specter of our form during
that winless streak. It has that period's lack of scoring chances, its indiscipline, and
a style miles from the open,
possession-based strategy most of us covet. Sunday offers a rare opportunity for a
second beginning, symbolic as well as real: not only are we playing
Orlando, the team against whom we began our season, but we do so with
(potentially, if improbably) up to five players who we didn't have even a month ago in Iraola,
Angelino, Pirlo, Lampard, and (depending on Visa status) Jefferson Mena.

But with the possibility these additions bring comes the danger of reliving the dire years in
miniature. If the winless streak was an artifact of the entire roster
fighting to assimilate to a community and tactical system that was (at that point) scarcely more
than imaginary, you sort of have to wonder what's going
to happen when almost half the squad is replaced in a matter of weeks. 

As Freud
tells us, community is not just created once: it is created anew 
by each individual coming to consciousness of it, each of whom has to repeat the sacrifices of every
other individual who came before. Freud is occupied, of course, by the
individual psychology; what he doesn't get into (at least here) is how these
discontents play out in aggregate, as the community itself. What would happen
if that process of re-invention were happening to a majority of the members in a
given civilization at the same time? My best guess is
that what looks like simple discontent in the individual looks like a massive rift in the
multitude. Some *Lord of the Flies* shit, in which
mere children working through the psychosexual chaos of their miniature
psyches replace
civilization itself. When there's not a critical mass of civilization to
assimilate *into*, in other words, I can't imagine it would be anything but
madness.

This is obviously bears only a pretty approximate relevance to the topic at
hand---I'd hope there aren't a lot of repressed sexual desires
going too directly into the tactical decisions around Sunday's match.
Nevertheless, there's a useful homology that leads me to this passage. The
relevant structure, whether civilization or a tactical system, is something in
which everyone participates, but which, nevertheless, each individual has to go
through alone. They have to achieve
some kind of experience with it that, I suspect, goes beyond simple understanding
and into a set of almost instinctual reactions and even principles of
(tactical) valuation.
When this pseudo-instinct is humming across all the players and the larger
group, it's remarkable, and it's immediately recognizable. (I think
I've heard it called "automatism" recently.) When it's not in place at all,
it's just as evident. It looks like someone going missing on the pitch or
passing to poltergeists, and it
usually results in a breakdown. So in football terms, scaling up---from one individual trying to fit in to a community (as Freud discusses) to most of a community
being recycled with different members---is a really big deal. What in a single
player looks like struggling to fit could look like anarchy in an entire squad.

I'll come to the point. If we expect to see even two of our new signings on Sunday, we
shouldn't be asking hopefully how much they can change about the way we play; we should be asking,
desperately, how *little*.

Think about how much of a calamity one player struggling to fit in our system
in particular
can make. On Saturday against the Revolution, our defense took itself apart and
handed the pieces to New England in one crucial passage of play. They did
so not in some
manic spurt of self-immolation, but because Iraola was dragged almost onto
the left half of the pitch, leaving whoever happened to walk by leagues of
space to pick up a ball and fire it. In his two matches, Iraola's played with three different
centerbacks besides Shay Facey, and has apparently reached an understanding
with none of them about his defensive role in the back four. This isn't
something I blame Iraola for, and I think he's a big improvement---and getting
more so every match, as the difference between the defensive cohesion against
New England and Toronto can attest. Rather, I think this is a gamble you take every time you introduce a
new player to a system, especially when their ideal tactical role demands a
change in the system they're entering.

Players whose personal style demands a systemic change---does that sound like Pirlo and Lampard? 
It does to me. 

There are obvious differences between, say, Pirlo and Iraola, and you have to
ignore
the sheer class of these incoming midfielders for a moment to even
make the argument I'm pursuing. But the danger is real, and it will take careful steps by
Kreis et al. to avoid disrupting the cohesion the team has fought hard for all
year. Better to underutilize the best players on the team than to
undercut what's
just started working so much that the team as a whole implodes---at least
while they get used to their new comrades.

What's less clear is whether there will also be an influx of fans along with
the newcomers on the pitch. I hope we welcome them if so, of course, but we'll see how these Jo(hn)nie-come-latelies
mesh with the still-thawing bums of those of us who were there on March 15th. I
suspect this off-the-pitch transition will be a bit easier.
