  And we realize this only at a point where they lapse
  Like a wave breaking on a rock, giving up
  Its shape in a gesture which expresses that shape.
  The forms retain a strong measure of ideal beauty
  As they forage in secret on our idea of distortion.
  Why be unhappy with this arrangement, since
  Dreams prolong us as they are absorbed?
  Something like living occurs, a movement 
  Out of the dream into its codification.

Very little survives the passage from concept to existence unscathed, but I think we've  about made it this time. It was enough of a strain to see the rosters filled out, adding some suddenly very real-sounding names from the benches of other MLS teams---names that, if you're like me, were largely anonymous but had a nice heft to them, plenty of, you know, consonants. Quite possibly, this tension is what lay beneath the outrage at the Lampard saga the whole time: more than ten thousand fans with an unarticulated fear that the team would be a fantasy or an elaborate con, looking that fear in the face and asking it some serious questions about its intentions with their daughter, how it takes its coffee, etc.

But what could be a more basic image of coming-to-be than Jacobson lobbing grenades of spittle into Brek Shea's terrible hair? Than the thunk of baldness on an upright, the nauseous terror of the third keeper warming up, and the relief when Saunders gets back up again? Than Brovsky's mustache, for Christ's sake? 

Not to mention the gut punch of a late equalizer, but let's be honest that anything else would have been kind of a train robbery. (Which would have explained the mustache, now that you mention it.) The notion that we'd start by disappointing 62,000 opposing fans only became palpable in the moment of its fading, like Ashbery's "wave breaking on a rock, giving up / Its shape in a gesture which expresses that shape." It forced us to reckon with the more preposterous of our expectations, that a team so recently a mere act of mind could stampede to unimpeded glory, taking all comers. But also like Ashbery's wave, the collapse was also the purest expression of the thing collapsing. The contingency[^1] of a shot caroming off the torso of an out-of-position Brovsky[^2] lets us keep whatever fantasies we had unsullied by realization. 

What we have in addition to that vision is the kind of team that endures, that grinds through persistent interruptions to its own apparent ideal of free-flowing football in the first half to emerge ascendant in the second. The ideal required the same kind of muscling into being ideals tend to, and this one will continue to demand it all season; but it's close enough to be visible.
