In this necessarily short post, I'll decline the short, easy reading. The notion that New York City FC, like a waterfall, seems to be falling and being scattered will now be exorcised by being mentioned. I'll also decline the despair this simplistic reading of a "fall" would imply—--or, as Gerard Manley Hopkins put it in a much more dire context: "Not, I'll not, carrion comfort, Despair, Not feast on thee." Even though hitting the bottom of the table as we have is not unlike being dashed on the rocks, even though we're [starting to seem like the easy win (or at least point) around the league](http://www.dynamotheory.com/2015/5/29/8678525/dynamo-nycfc-2015-matchday-14)---even though most of anyone's worst fears about how we'd start the season have been thoroughly realized---this one, short paragraph is all I'll give to misery. Here: here it is. It's done.

Heaney's reading of a waterfall is, of course, much more complicated.<!--break--> It shares with the recent fortunes of NYCFC its morass of inherent contradictions: the "burn" that "drowns steadily in its downpour," the "Simultaneous acceleration / And sudden braking." I can't tell---and I don't know if *anyone* at this point can---whether we're getting worse or better, judging from performances rather than results. There were plays that made NYC seem dominant, but suddenly the defense would be floundering in its own third or Saunders would be picking the ball out of the net. But I recognize something more fundamental, too, about that static motion, the closely bounded fury of Heaney's waterfall. I recognize the latent power of something going unexpressed, not by sheer chance but as *a function of the thing's form*, something already implied by the arrangment of itse elements. The waterfall has all this massive power without direction, shackled, as Heaney shows us, by a structure that causes that power to cancel itself out. It defeats itself, it "is swallowed up / And regurgitated through this long throat"---it's own long throat.

Imagine a magnificent machine, vastly potent but reliant on many tiny parts. It doesn't need each of its parts to be animated---it'll clomp around okay with a few missing, well enough that you can point and plausibly say "Hark! Massive fucking robot!"---but most of what it can do will remain as potential until every piece is perfectly fitted. Without the last part or two, that machine will be like a gun unfired, or more to the point, used as a hammer because it's missing a trigger. Like the waterfall, it will have all that power still *in* it, somewhere, but the power will be completely inaccessible.[^1]

NYCFC as it stands is like this machine, missing a few essential pieces that make all of what's promising in it completely unusable. For a European example, you can think of the difference Francis Coquelin made in Arsenal's EPL season: despite being wildly front-loaded with attacking power, without this reliable holding midfielder to keep possession and guard against the break, nothing was clicking in either direction. As soon as he showed up, Arsenal's form turned around as if on a pivot. So it may be that we need a different design, need to go back to the drawing boards to create a system that will work with the pieces we already have. It may be that this *is* the best design, but no matter how you slice it, a few things are still missing.

If the latter, I can hazard a guess as to what's missing: I think improving our fullbacks (or resolving our lack of them), finishing, and accuracy of passes into the box would get us 90% of the way there. I know, that's more than a few small parts. But if even one falls into place, we could be most of the way there. 

Still, one of them has to change. Until one does, we the spectators will continue to empathetically feel the fall as the "eye rides over and downwards, falls with / Hurtling tons that slabber and spill, / Falls, yet records the tumult thus standing still."

[^1]: I think this is kind of a low-rent version of something from Heidegger, believe it or not (I wouldn't). I'll update this if I have a chance to find it: something about "challenging" elements to release their natural latent potential, maybe.
