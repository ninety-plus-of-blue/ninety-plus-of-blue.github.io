  Dear friends,
  more than one man, or two, should know those things
  Kirkê foresaw for us and shared with me,
  so let me tell her forecast&#58; then we die
  with our eyes open, if we are going to die,
  or know what death we baffle if we can.

Just hold on: this is not pessimism. Odysseus knows what's coming for him and his crew, and though what's coming are the sirens, Skylla and Kharybdis, Odysseus *guides them through*.
