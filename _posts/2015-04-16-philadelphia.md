  For five or ten years they worked together, growing stronger and wiser and more and more mutually attached...they had been reared in the atmosphere of such heroic struggle that the stock must have been toughened somewhat. Left alone in that terrific orphanhood, they had clung together, supporting one another…and developing unknown powers in the stress of new necessity.

The evolution metaphor has to be among the most overused, least considered, and potentially most pernicious of any common figures of speech in American culture. So I invoke it here carefully here in reference to NYCFC. The problem with the metaphor is that it's rarely specified to include the absolute chance mutation that defines actual evolution, having been replaced, apparently, by the Pokémon[^a] version.[^1] It's an even more peculiar version of evolution that Charlotte Perkins Gilman concocts in her 1915 novel *Herland*, a utopian novel in which a society of women who (re)produce parthenogenetically[^2] develops over the course of thousands of years, in the absence of men, into a perfectly functioning socialism.<!--break--> Gilman's unique vision of evolution shares many traits with the non-Darwinian paradigm, now long discredited, of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, in which it is suggested traits acquired during a lifetime can be passed on to future generations. As we now know, this is not how it works. But Lamarck's theory is in some ways much more in line with how we tend to use evolution metaphorically, in that it allows for some imputation of agency to the individual organism and the increased relevance of the life it lives to the development of the species.

When I say, then, that this dense thicket of three games in eight days is likely to be a period of rapid evolution for NYCFC, I know that what I'm *about* to say about rapid mutation and natural selection is going to be a little off of the true, Darwinian sense of evolution. But Lamarckian evolution, if embraced, can be even more useful as a metaphor than its alternatives. 

To grow "stronger and wiser and more and more attached": what else could we want for the first half of the season? The two elements we've seen in the first two games of the über week have been marked by high variation in a relatively short period. In actual evolution, the reason things like viruses so quickly outpace vaccines is the presence of these two elements. Short lifespans decrease the period, a large population increases the number of mutations. When put together, these factors lead to rapid (at least on a human timescale) evolution of a strain.[^3] Instead of a short lifespan and large population, of course, we have a high number of changes to the system and starting lineup over a short enough period that the effects are immediately visible. Shelton in for ninety, at last, to make a more 4-3-3-like formation; Calle to left back; at the half of game two, both Poku and Watson-Siriboe reminding us of the promise they showed against Sporting KC, and solidifying it by repetition. By the end of Sunday's match against Portland, I think we'll be closer to knowing our strongest starting eleven than at any point so far this season. And whatever that eleven looks like, it will be more dangerous as a result this difficult stretch than it could have ever been.

But the environment's influence on the *Herland* society's evolution does not take a Darwinian form, and neither does it for NYCFC. *Herland*'s environment lacks the high death rates and intense sexual competition, which is (almost literally) the whole point of Gilman's system. Her evolution is instead more closely imbricated with the development of social forms. The "stock" is "toughened" by collective suffering of a difficult experience, but in the novel this takes the shape of carefully planned social and cultural modes. For an analogue, we might turn to the ethos of hard work and solidarity[^4] increasingly evident in every aspect of NYCFC as a team. 

For Gilman, of course, the experience is passed on to future generations directly: a certain transmission of toughness and ability that we might normally think of as a product of education is literalized to be physical, genetic. There is something about Shelton's play that has this sense of generational development of qualities, though of course not literally, and I think we'll see more of this kind of promise from the education of the younger members of the squad, have the same joy in watching them develop. Herein lies the reason I like the Lamarckian version of the evolution metaphor: it has more variety baked into its mechanisms, and as such more closely mirrors non-physical change that can actually be seen. That it has long since been disproven does nothing to limit its metaphorical usefulness.

Surely this sense of visible evolution in the team and its players can give context to the enthusiasm for the rise of Khiry Shelton in particular, a player whose youth gives him promise as a fixture for seasons to come. His start Thursday was met with wild support from the home crowd even though he has yet to score in a competitive match. I don't think I'm alone in saying that I'd rather see the unknown members of the team develop *as* NYCFC players than watch big-ticket DPs, whose development is largely finished and happend elsewhere, for their own sake. 

Sunday, the evolution will continue. I suspect we'll recognize it as the fruition of two games' worth of frustration and the development resulting therefrom, whether or not we are frustrated again. 

[^1]: A few years ago, I was doing some teaching on the writing side of a course on evolutionary biology, and it became clear that students were using the term in this Pokémon sense: the virus evolves *in order to do* x or y. No. The virus just evolves. There's no agent, no intention, no "in order to." As Nietzsche would have it: "'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed."

[^2]: I.e., without fertilization. The framing of this development as evolutionary is a bit ridiculous, of course, and looks more like an act of God. But then, it *is* fiction, and speculative fiction at that.

[^3]: On the off chance that an evolutionary biologist is reading this, feel free to correct these avowedly broad strokes.
