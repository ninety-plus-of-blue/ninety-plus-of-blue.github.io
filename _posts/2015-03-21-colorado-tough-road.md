The first of, presumably, many difficult games on the road---but I think there's reason to believe this one will have been the most difficult on the supporters. Even an NYCFC cynic expecting the team to fail would assume a glorious failure, a spectacular collapse. We're simply not equipped for ugly mediocrity. And except for the remarkable performance of Josh Saunders, from whom one almost expects it at this point, ugly mediocrity is what was on display in Colorado.

At risk of apologia, though, I think either the ugliness or the mediocrity, and maybe both, can be attributed to the location. That makes Saturday's match the third running in which location has made a potentially crucial difference in the play and, potentially, the result.<!--break--> This in turn makes it pretty hard to figure out how well things are going versus how well they ought to be: as of last week I think most would say we looked well ahead of schedule, but this week we looked far from anyone's idea of competitive. So what's in a place? What goes into a home-field advantage, and is it real? 

The home-field advantage thing has always sort of baffled me because the mechanism was never clear, and though I'm not equipped to address the effects of playing at home quantitatively, the first three matches give pretty neat case-studies in a few different possibilities: atmosphere, pitch conditions, and the physical location of the stadium.
