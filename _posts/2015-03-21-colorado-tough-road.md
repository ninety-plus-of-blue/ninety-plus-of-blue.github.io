The first of (you sort of have to imagine) many difficult games on the road---but I think there's reason to believe this one will have been the most difficult on the supporters. Even an NYCFC cynic expecting the team to fail would assume a glorious failure, a spectacular collapse. We're simply not equipped for ugly mediocrity. And except for the remarkable performance of Josh Saunders, from whom one almost expects it at this point, ugly mediocrity is what was on display in Colorado.

At risk of apologia, though, I think either the ugliness or the mediocrity, and maybe both, can be attributed to location. That makes Saturday's match the third running in which location has made a potentially crucial difference in the play and, potentially, the result.<!--break--> This in turn makes it pretty hard to figure out how well things are going versus how well they ought to be: after last week I think most would have said we looked well ahead of schedule, but this week we looked far from anyone's idea of competitive. So what's in a place? What actually constitutes a home-field advantage, and to what extent is it even real? Put another way, to what extent can we say that the "nothing" we saw on Saturday, like the "something" we saw the previous Sunday, "happens anywhere," and to what extent is it dependent on its environment? 

The home-field advantage thing has always sort of baffled me because the mechanism was never clear, and though I'm not equipped to address the effects of playing at home quantitatively, the first three matches give pretty neat case-studies in a few different possibilities: crowd atmosphere, pitch conditions, and the physical location of the stadium.

I'll say now, I think somewhat controversially, that NYCFC is a better club than Orlando City SC. And while no home-field advantage due to atmosphere can be cited in the (still not bearable, absolutely bullshit) free-kick deflection that resulted in the equalizer, everything leading up to it can probably be understood in those terms. Passes to nowhere; an invisible star player; frustrating lateral movement. The difference between what they were capable of and what they delivered can be measured by the heavily referenced difference between the first and second halves. If a stiff team-talk and a shot in the arm of Ã©lan can make that kind of a difference, there's something going on that isn't tactical and isn't physical; and therefore the problem is something that could be imputed to the squishiest, least empirical factor, non-literal "atmosphere."
