The first of (you sort of have to imagine) many difficult games on the road---but I think there's reason to believe this one will have been the most difficult on the supporters. Even an NYCFC cynic expecting the team to fail would assume a glorious failure, a spectacular collapse. We're simply not equipped for ugly mediocrity. And except for the remarkable performance of Josh Saunders, from whom one almost expects it at this point, ugly mediocrity is what was on display in Colorado.

At risk of apologia, though, I think either the ugliness or the mediocrity, and maybe both, can be attributed to location. That makes Saturday's match the third running in which location has made a potentially crucial difference in the play and, potentially, the result.<!--break--> This in turn makes it pretty hard to figure out how well things are going versus how well they ought to be: after last week I think most would have said we looked well ahead of schedule, but this week we looked far from anyone's idea of competitive. So what's in a place? What actually constitutes a home-field advantage, and to what extent is it even real? Put another way, to what extent can we say that the "nothing" we saw on Saturday, like the "something" we saw the previous Sunday, "happens anywhere," and to what extent is it dependent on its environment? 

The home-field advantage thing has always sort of baffled me because the mechanism was never clear, and though I'm not equipped to address the effects of playing at home quantitatively, the first three matches give pretty neat case-studies in a few different possibilities: crowd atmosphere, pitch conditions, and the physical location of the stadium.

I'll say now, I think somewhat controversially, that NYCFC is a better club than Orlando City SC. And while no home-field advantage due to atmosphere can be cited in the (still not bearable, absolutely bullshit) free-kick deflection that resulted in the equalizer, everything leading up to it can probably be understood in those terms. Passes to nowhere; an invisible star player; frustrating lateral movement. The difference between what they were capable of and what they delivered can be measured by the heavily referenced difference between the first and second halves. If a stiff team-talk and a shot in the arm of élan can make that kind of a difference, there's something going on that isn't tactical and isn't physical. Certainly, any home-crowd atmosphere that could have worked against us in Orlando was reversed in our inaugural home opener, and in addition to it the peculiarities of an outfield-turned-pitch have been much discussed, grumped about by NYCFC's detractors and downplayed by its supporters. But most people seem to agree that the peculiar proportions and non-right angles could gradually contribute to a home-pitch boost as we get more used to it ourselves. To say that any of these advantages is unfair would be as familiar as it would be untenable. Without standardizing pitches, stadiums, even crowds, these differences are going to remain.

Which unfortunately makes it unreasonable for me to gripe about the effects of altitude on Saturday's match. The effects themselves are indisputable as far as our players were concerned, with many of them doubled over after thirty minutes and everyone who has played at such altitudes agreeing on the severity of the difference. But what about other effects of altitude? I'd draw attention here to three of Villa's outrageous, completely uncharacteristic shots far from any recognizable target: the free kick that left at least the Colorado commentator entirely at a loss[^1] and the two very similar off-target efforts to the top-right corner.[^2] All were clearly meant to dip in the manner extremely commonplace in Villa's own arsenal and others',[^3] and such dips vary in their degree according to the surrounding air pressure. Commerce City, with an elevation of over 5,000 feet, would have a severe enough difference to account for those wild-seeming misses.[^4] The effects of a location on the most physical aspects of the game are further-reaching than it might seem.

All of this is the same as to ask whether in football, as in Larkin's view of life, "'Nothing, like something, happens anywhere,'" we are forced to concede that "'it's not the place's fault.'" The answer is almost certainly yes. But if we consider our doubled-over blues and shots to nowhere, we sort of have to add a caveat: that more nothing will happen somewhere like Commerce City, Colorado for opponents from a less ungodly altitude.

[^4]: I'm quite pleased that I was able to confirm this intuition via U. of Illinois physicist Dan Whobrey's article ["Baseball at High Altitude"](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/Denver.html). Anticipating a very similar (altitude-differential-wise) test case of the Boston Red Sox versus the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, he calculated the relevant forces on a curve ball (which should be the same as a shot curled toward the top-right corner). The relevant force here is the "Magnus force," and since "the air density in Denver (5280 ft) [cf. Commerce City's 5,164 ft] is about 82% of that at sea level (0.0627 vs. 0.0764 lb/cubic ft at 70 deg F). Therefore, we can expect that the drag and Magnus forces in Coors will be about 82% of their values at Fenway." This translates directly to the amount of curve on a pitch/shot: "If we take 18 inches as a typical break at Fenway due to the Magnus force, an identically thrown pitch will break only about 82% as much--or about 14-15 inches--at Coors." Take a look at those shots again and try to see what kind of a difference 18% could make: we're talking at least on-target.
