The concept for this site is simple, if a bit odd: short weekly essays about NYCFC's current season, where each result is matched with a literary quotation that in some way helps me talk about it. The first post, for example, uses John Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror," which is useful to me insofar as it helps me talk about the strangeness of an imaginary team becoming, suddenly, very real.
