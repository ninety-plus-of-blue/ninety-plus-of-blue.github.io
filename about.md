The concept for this site[^1] is simple, if a bit odd: short weekly essays about NYCFC's current season, where each result is matched with a literary quotation that in some way helps me talk about it. The first post, for example, uses John Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror" to help me talk about the strangeness of an imaginary team becoming, suddenly, very real.

These essays will not be tactical analyses. There are plenty of people who can do that much better than I ever could, and they're doing so. I hope instead to address some of what happening off the pitch, to think through not only the unofficial development of the club, its ethos, and its fan culture, but also these categories in general. In this sense, what I'm doing is more in the Nick Hornby line of football writing than, say, the Jonathan Wilson line. I could go one step further with this: my project is actually kind of enabled by Hornby's 1992 memoir. There's a kind of analysis that football opens itself up to that differs from the analysis of tactics and results. It's that other kind that I'm after here.

In most ways this is the only way I can contribute to the game that takes up much of my excess attention---and quite a lot of the attention I'm supposed to be using for other things, as well. I'm a doctoral student in English and Comparative Literature, which implies a few things about the genesis of this project. First, that it will be of no interest to many except those who have wrong with them whatever I have wrong with me. Second, that it is probably a product of my inability to think of much without filtering those thoughts through literature. And finally, that seasons of turning from a book I'm supposed to be reading to check a score or investigate a piece of transfer gossip seem finally to have resulted in a blending of the two. Let's hope I don't get chucked out of my department.
