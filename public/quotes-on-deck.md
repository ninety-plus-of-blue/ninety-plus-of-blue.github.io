'Why do we call all our generous ideas illusions, and the mean ones truths? Isn't it a sufficient condemnation of society to find one's self accepting such phraseology?'

Edith Wharton, House of Mirth

'You look as if you wished the place in Hell,'<br>
My friend said, 'judging from your fac.' 'Oh well,<br>
I suppose it's not the place's fault,' I said.<br>
<br>
'Nothing, like something, happens anywhere.'

Philip Larkin, "I Remember, I Remember"
