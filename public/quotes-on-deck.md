'Why do we call all our generous ideas illusions, and the mean ones truths? Isn't it a sufficient condemnation of society to find one's self accepting such phraseology?'

Edith Wharton, House of Mirth

"Ah, but I don't suppose that: haven't I told you that your genius lies in converting impulses into intentions?"<br>
<br>
"My genius?" she echoed with a sudden note of weariness. "Is there any final test of genius but success? And I certainly haven't succeeded."<br>
<br> 
...<br>

Only one thought consoled her, and that was the contemplation of Lily's beauty. She studied it with a kind of passion, as though it were some weapon she had slowly fashioned for her vengeance. ...but Lily understood that beauty is only the raw material of conquest, and that to convert it into success other arts are required.


"But you had taken on a greater, and more harmful, illusion. The illusion of control. That A could do B. But that was false. Completely. No one can *do*. Things only happen, A and B are unreal, are names for parts that ought to be inseparable...."<br>

When one event happens after another with this awful regularity, of course you don't automatically assume that it's cause-and-effect. But you do look for some mechanism to make sense of it. You probe, you design a modest experiment....<br>
There is to this enterprise, Pointsman knows, a danger of seduction. Because of the symmetry..... He's been led before, you know, down the garden path by symmetry: in certain test results... in assuming that a mechanism must imply its mirror image.

Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rainbow
