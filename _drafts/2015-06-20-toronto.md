quote: |
When thirty rolling years have run their race, <br>
Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space, <br>
Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame, <br>
Which from this omen shall receive the name. <br>
Time shall approve the truth. For what remains, <br>
And how with sure success to crown thy pains, <br>
With patience next attend. A banish'd band, <br>
Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land, <br>
Have planted here...These make thy friends, and on their aid rely. <br>
To thy free passage I submit my streams. ...In times to come, <br>
My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome.<br>
