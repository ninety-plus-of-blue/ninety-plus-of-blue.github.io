  "But you had taken on a greater, and more harmful, illusion. The illusion of control. That A could do B. But that was false. Completely. No one can <i>do</i>. Things only happen, A and B are unreal, are names for parts that ought to be inseparable...."<br>
  <br>
  When one event happens after another with this awful regularity, of course you don't automatically assume that it's cause-and-effect. But you do look for some mechanism to make sense of it. You probe, you design a modest experiment....<br>
  <br>
  There is to this enterprise, Pointsman knows, a danger of seduction. Because of the symmetry..... He's been led before, you know, down the garden path by symmetry: in certain test results... in assuming that a mechanism must imply its mirror image.
